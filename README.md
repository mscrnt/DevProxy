# DevProxy

A local-only admin bridge for secure LLM development workflows

## ‚ö†Ô∏è IMPORTANT SECURITY WARNING ‚ö†Ô∏è

**DevProxy provides elevated system access through an API. USE AT YOUR OWN RISK.**

This tool allows external programs (including AI assistants) to execute commands on your Windows system with elevated privileges. While security measures are in place, you should understand the risks:

- **Elevated Privileges**: Commands run with the same permissions as the DevProxy service
- **Potential for Misuse**: Even with whitelisting, PowerShell access can be dangerous
- **Token Security**: Anyone with the API token can execute commands
- **AI Integration Risks**: AI assistants may execute unintended commands

**By using DevProxy, you acknowledge these risks and take full responsibility for any consequences.**

## Overview

DevProxy is a secure, local-only admin API for Windows development tasks. It runs as an elevated Windows service and exposes a localhost-only JSON API that allows trusted local agents (like Claude running in WSL) to execute safe build-related commands and file operations.

## Features

- üîí **Secure by Design**: Localhost-only binding (configurable port)
- üõ°Ô∏è **Token Authentication**: API token required for all requests
- ‚úÖ **Command Whitelisting**: Only allows pre-approved development commands
- üìÅ **Path Restrictions**: Operations limited to approved directories
- üö´ **System Protection**: Blocks access to Windows system directories
- üìù **Comprehensive Logging**: All requests logged with full details
- ü™ü **Windows Service**: Runs as an auto-start Windows service
- üñ•Ô∏è **System Tray GUI**: Admin panel for easy configuration

## Installation

1. **Build the executables:**
   ```batch
   scripts\build.bat
   ```
   Or manually:
   ```bash
   go build -o devproxy.exe cmd/devproxy/main.go
   go build -o devctl.exe cmd/devctl/main.go
   ```

2. **Run interactively (for testing):**
   ```batch
   devproxy.exe
   ```

3. **Install as Windows service (Run as Administrator):**
   ```batch
   scripts\service.bat install
   ```

## Critical Setup Steps

### 1. Generate and Secure Your Token

When DevProxy runs for the first time, it generates a unique API token. This token is your only line of defense against unauthorized access.

1. Run DevProxy interactively first: `devproxy.exe`
2. Copy the generated token from the console output
3. Find the token in `config/config.json` under the `"token"` field
4. **NEVER** commit this token to version control
5. **NEVER** share this token publicly

### 2. Configure for AI Assistant Use

If you're using DevProxy with an AI assistant (Claude, ChatGPT, etc.):

1. Create a `CLAUDE.md` or similar file in your project
2. Add the token to this file for the AI to use
3. **IMPORTANT**: Add this file to `.gitignore`
4. Consider the risks of giving an AI system access

Example CLAUDE.md format:
```markdown
# DevProxy Access

**Token**: your-generated-token-here

Use this token with devctl.exe or API calls to execute Windows commands.
```

### 3. Review and Restrict Allowed Commands

The default configuration includes PowerShell, which is powerful but dangerous. Review `config/config.json` and remove any commands you don't need:

```json
{
  "allowed_commands": [
    "go", "msbuild", "dotnet", "npm", "node", "python", "pip"
    // Consider removing "powershell" if not needed
  ]
}
```

## Configuration

On first run, DevProxy creates a `config/config.json` file with:
- Generated API token (save this securely!)
- Allowed commands list
- Allowed path patterns
- Log file location
- Port number (default: 2223)

Example configuration:
```json
{
  "api_token": "your-generated-token-here",
  "allowed_commands": [
    "go", "msbuild", "signtool", "powershell",
    "dotnet", "gcc", "g++", "make", "cmake",
    "npm", "node", "python", "pip"
  ],
  "allowed_paths": [
    "C:\\Dev",
    "C:\\Users\\*\\Projects",
    "C:\\Users\\*\\source\\repos"
  ],
  "log_file": "logs\\log.txt",
  "port": 2223
}
```

‚ö†Ô∏è **Path Wildcard Warning**: Wildcards in paths (e.g., `C:\Users\*\Projects`) may not work as expected. Use specific paths when possible.

### System Tray GUI

Run `devproxy-tray.exe` to access the admin panel where you can:
- Start/Stop/Restart the service
- Change the port number
- Manage allowed paths
- View and regenerate the API token
- Edit allowed commands

## API Usage

### Run Command Endpoint

**POST** `/run`

Headers:
- `X-Admin-Token: your-api-token`
- `Content-Type: application/json`

Request body:
```json
{
  "command": "go",
  "args": ["build", "-o", "out.exe"],
  "cwd": "C:\\Dev\\MyApp"
}
```

Response:
```json
{
  "stdout": "...",
  "stderr": "",
  "exit_code": 0
}
```

## Security Features

### Blocked Operations
- System directories (C:\Windows, C:\Program Files, etc.)
- Registry modifications
- Service management commands
- System shutdown/restart commands
- Path traversal attempts (..)

### Blocked Keywords
- `reg`, `shutdown`, `format`, `schtasks`, `sc`, `net`, `bcdedit`, `diskpart`

## Using with AI Assistants

### From WSL (e.g., Claude)

AI assistants running in WSL can use devctl.exe directly:

```bash
/mnt/c/path/to/devctl.exe -token YOUR_TOKEN -cwd C:\\Dev command args
```

### Security Considerations for AI Use

1. **Audit Regularly**: Review `logs/log.txt` frequently
2. **Limit Scope**: Only allow paths where AI should operate
3. **Remove Dangerous Commands**: Consider removing PowerShell access
4. **Monitor Activity**: Watch for unexpected command patterns
5. **Revoke Access**: Regenerate token if you suspect misuse

## Service Management

```batch
# Install and start service
scripts\service.bat install

# Stop service
scripts\service.bat stop

# Start service
scripts\service.bat start

# Check service status
scripts\service.bat status

# Uninstall service
scripts\service.bat uninstall
```

## Testing from WSL

Using curl:
```bash
curl -X POST http://127.0.0.1:2223/run \
  -H "X-Admin-Token: your-token-here" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "command": "go",
    "args": ["version"],
    "cwd": "C:\\Dev"
  }'
```

## Logs

All operations are logged to `logs/log.txt` in JSON format, including:
- Timestamp
- Source IP
- Command and arguments
- Working directory
- Output (stdout/stderr)
- Exit code
- Status (completed/rejected)
- Rejection reason (if applicable)

**Review logs regularly to ensure no unauthorized or unintended commands are being executed.**

## Best Practices

1. **Token Management**
   - Regenerate tokens periodically
   - Never share tokens in public repositories
   - Use different tokens for different projects

2. **Command Restrictions**
   - Remove commands you don't need
   - Avoid PowerShell if possible
   - Use specific tools instead of general interpreters

3. **Path Restrictions**
   - Be as specific as possible with allowed paths
   - Avoid wildcards when possible
   - Never allow access to system directories

4. **Monitoring**
   - Check logs daily
   - Set up alerts for suspicious commands
   - Review AI assistant interactions
